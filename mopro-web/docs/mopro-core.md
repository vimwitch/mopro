# mopro-core

Core mobile Rust library. For FFI, see `mopro-ffi` which is a thin wrapper for exposing UniFFI bindings around this library.

## Overview

TBD.

## Examples

Run `cargo run --example circom`. Also see `examples/circom/README.md` for more information.

## Build dylib

Experimental support.

Turns `.wasm` file into a dynamic library (`.dylib`).

Run:

`cargo build --features dylib`

After that you'll see location of the dylib file:

```
warning: Building dylib for aarch64-apple-darwin
warning: Dylib location: /Users/user/repos/github.com/zkmopro/mopro/mopro-core/target/debug/aarch64-apple-darwin/keccak256.dylib
```

Right now this is hardcoded for `rsa`.

Note that:

-   It has to be built for the right architecture
-   Have to run `install_name_tool` to adjust install name
-   Run `codesign` to sign dylib for use on iOS

### Script

-   Add third argument `dylib`
-   Add forth argument with name of dylib, e.g. `rsa` if you want `rsa.dylib`

`./scripts/update_bindings.sh device release dylib rsa`

Note that `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` must be set.

## To use ark-zkey

Experimental support for significantly faster zkey loading. See `../ark-zkey` README for how to build arkzkey.

## To run msm benchmark report on laptop

`cargo run --release --features gpu-benchmarks --package mopro-core --bin generate_benchmark_report`

The report will be in `mopro-core/benchmarks/gpu_explorations/msm_bench_rust_laptop.csv`.

## To use [circom-witness-rs](https://github.com/philsippl/circom-witness-rs) (Experimental)

-   Set
    ```toml
    [witness]
    use_native_witness_generation = true
    ```
    in `config.toml` file
-   Or build witness with
    ```sh
    WITNESS_CPP=<CIRCOM_PATH> cargo build --features build-native-witness --release
    ```
    Test with
    ```sh
    cargo test --features calc-native-witness
    ```
